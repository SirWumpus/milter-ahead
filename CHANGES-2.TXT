--2.0--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

  !!	The cache code has been completely replaced, including many of
  	the options:
  		
  		Old				New
  		----------------------------------------------------
  		cache-file		->	cache-path
  		cache-type		
  		cache-gc-frequency	->	cache-gc-interval
  						cache-multicast-ip
  						cache-multicast-port
  						cache-secret
  						cache-unicast-domain
  						cache-unicast-port
  						
  	The cache is now an SQLite3 database, which allows the
	sqlite3(1) utility or similar to be used to manipulate
	individual records. It also allows for improved garbage
	collection. The garbage collection is now handled by a
	separate timer thread, which allows for predictable and
	regular behaviour.
  	
  	The most significant feature change is the introduction of the
	multicast / unicast cache, which provides a fast, simple, and
	efficient means to share cache updates across multiple
	machines on the same network segment. The multicast cache uses
	a broadcast-and-correct model. It support IPv4 and IPv6.
	
	When multicast caching is not possible a unicast variant is
	possible where cache updates are sent to the MX list of the
	specified domain.
