CHANGES
-------

The major number changes for such things as code rewrites, changes in
syntax, and/or dramatic changes in functionality. The minor number
changes for corrections, enhancements, etc. made to the code. There
is no set schedule for releases.

--TODO--

   +	Add ability to call ahead to a POP3 server to verify a user.
   	Problem: needs a user password to truly validate the user.
   	Suggested by Ryan Moore.

   +	Add support for :port specifier with host name or IP in RHS
   	of call-ahead-db records. Requested by Mark Hellegers.

--1.13.1--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.22

   !	Fixed isReservedIP* macro changes.

--1.13--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8

   !	Configure and build changes to reflect changes in libsnert.

   !	Fixes for changes in the PDQ API introduced by libsnert 1.75.0.

--1.12--

   !	mxConnect: Switch to PDQ API.

   !	mxConnect: Replaced socketOpenClient with socketClient so as to
	handle multi-home hosts.

   -	Disable try-implicit-mx code. PDQ MX lookup handles this
	automatically.

   !	Fix Postfix issues concerning {client_name} and {client_addr}
   	always coming back NULL. Use smfProlog to save the client name
   	and address supplied to filterOpen in the workspace.

   +	Added -version and -info command options.

   +	Add special SMTP command "STAT milter-ahead" that reports some
   	basic process data. Can only be used from localhost for
   	security concerns. Appears to work only with sendmail and not
   	postfix.

   +	Updated documentation concerning "combo" tag support added in
   	libsnert.

   +	Removed ENABLE_BLACKLIST macros in favour of it	always being
	compiled in. The original argument to disable blacklisting was
	that sendmail already had its own mechanism; however libsnert
	milter support provides a richer syntax especially with the
	addition of combo tags. Also it makes documentation easier.

--1.11--

   !	filterRcpt: Fixed bug as a result of changes in libsnert 1.72.5
	concerning the separation of IO errors from not-found answers in
	smdb API (made for BarricadeMX use of socketmaps).

	The call-ahead-db option uses the smdb API. When disabled, the
	call to smdbAccessDomain used to returned SMDB_ACCESS_NOT_FOUND,
	but now returns SMDB_ACCESS_TEMPFAIL with a "TEMPFAIL" string on
	error.

	call-ahead-db values are similar to mailertable, thus smdbAccess
	routinues should always return SMDB_ACCESS_UNKNOWN and a string;
	anything else is invalid for call-ahead-db and can be ignored.

--1.10--

   !	Postfix milter support does not provide many of the sendmail
   	macros and may have broken {rcpt_addr} support in 2.5. So now
   	when {rcpt_addr} is undefined, fall back on the original
   	recipient argument given to the filterRcpt handler. In sendmail
   	{rcpt_addr} might be different after virtusertable mapping.
   	Reported by Alex Broens.

   !	filterRcpt: check for empty string for {rcpt_addr} macro and use
	the function argument instead if so. Reported by Zachary
	Boschert.

   !	Allow +ignore-rcpt-host in combination with +mx-lookup in order
	to skip falling back on the {rcpt_host} value when no MX answers.
	Requested by Sebastian Wiesinger.

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--1.9--

   +	The call-ahead-db option now supports sendmail mailertable
	formatted database. This allows the call-ahead-db to be
	replaced by a mailertable directly without modification if
	desired. The actual mailer portion of the right-hand-side is
	ignored, except for error: and local:, which have special
	meaning in sendmail. This facility will also work for
	postfix's transport file, which has a similar format.
	Requested by Alex Broens.

--1.8--

  !!	Fixed issue with +mx-lookups and mailertable, where using host
	names (vs. IPs) within square brackets, which disables MX
	lookups, would report a "DNS name not found" (rcode 3) error
	looking up the MX records, before proceeding to try the actual
	host name without square brakets. Reported by Greg Matthews.

   !	milter-ahead-connect and milter-ahead-from tags failed to white
	list through the max-failures options. Reported by Greg
	Matthews.

--1.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.64

   +	Added missing is-blind-mx documentation. Reported by Uni
	Bielefeld.

   !	is-blind-mx: Since the documentation was missing and not all
	admins. check the change log, some saw unexpected behaviour.
	This option is now off by default to maintain original
	historical behaviour. Requested by Hansj√ºrg Wenger.

   !	is-blind-mx: If the is-blind-mx test is disabled, the cache
	lookups for blind hosts still could still prevent call-ahead
	based on an old record. Added a guard condition to only check
	the cache for blind hosts when the test is enabled.

  !!	Cached 4xy temporary failure results should not transmute into
	a 5xy rejection result. Reported by Uni Bielefeld. Have opted
	not to cache any temporary failure, because many such results
	can correct themselves before the cache entry expires,
	resulting in unnecessary delays. Better to redo the call-ahead
	in such cases.

   !	LibSnert: socketCreateOpen() enhancement to support [hostname]:port
   	syntax same as [IPv6]:port. This allows the RHS of records in
   	the call-ahead-db to specify a port. See call-ahead-db option.

--1.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63

   !	Restore access-db to its disabled by default at start-up. The
   	change from short to long option format broke this.

   +	Added is-blind-mx option. Remember if a downstream {rcpt_host}
	falls into the accept- then- bounce class. Skip future call-
	aheads and accept mail for such machines. Entry never expires.
	Requested by FSL.

   +	Cache SMTP responses & text reasons. A cache hit will report
	the cached response instead of a generic "user unknown".
	Requested by many.

   !	atExitCleanUp(): added NULL guard around cache cleanup code in
   	case its the cache was not initialised.

   !	Hardcode exclusion for LAN and localhost from +primary-up-reject.

   !	Corrected documentation error concerning two cache-type
	options when it should have been cache-file and cache-type.

   !	Recommended default for cache-reject-ttl lowered to 90000
   	seconds.

   +	access-db and call-ahead-db now support socket-map, flat-
	file, and SQLite3 lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The
	SQLite3 behaviour can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure
	script.

--1.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.62

   +	Added NULL guards for rcpt_addr, rcpt_host, and rcpt_mailer
	macros since they might be undefined because of a broken .mc
	file or Postfix 2.3.

   !	mxConnect(): The {if_addr} macro was used to compare against
   	the MX list to see if our IP address is one of the MXes in
   	order to determine the max. preference value. However,
   	Postfix 2.3 does not support {if_addr} macro, so when its
   	value is undefined, default to the value of the interface-ip
   	option that is either specified or determined at startup.

   !	When {if_addr}, {if_name}, and j macros are underfined fall
   	back onto the value of interface-name instead of "[127.0.0.1]"
   	for use with the call-ahead HELO.

   !	The "looks like a local recipient, skipping" test has been
	changed in order to support Postfix 2.3 which does not support
	{rcpt_host} nor a mailertable. The options call-ahead-host,
	call-ahead-db, and/or mx-lookup can be used to select the next
	hop for the call-ahead. Failure to find a next hop is assumed
	to be because the recipient is local to this host.

   !	call-ahead-host now sets the rcpt_host earlier for logging.

   +	verbose=db should apply to call-ahead-db even when access-db
	is disabled.

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

--1.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61

   +	Added cache-remove-all to the experimental SMTP commands:

   		milter-ahead cache-remove-all

   !	Moved "no acceptable MX server" log message to be immediately
   	after the MX pruning / preference search loop, to better
   	reflect what is beening reported.

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

   !	Fix possible race condition in updating cache entries. Replaced
	cachePut() with cacheUpdate().

   +	max-failures option added. If an SMTP client causes too many
   	call-ahead failures, then it will be blocked until the cache
   	entry expires. Requested by Kevin Brooks. Please note that the
   	cache format has changed; discard the old cache.

--1.3--

   !	Requires LibSnert 1.60

  !!	Due to too many support questions resulting from the addition of
  	B/W list support, I've choosen to _disable_ by default the
  	consultation of the access database. To enable it, explicitly
  	specify the -f option:

  		-f /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

  	This will maintain historical pre-1.0 behaviour, which is less
  	confusing for existing postmasters who upgraded.

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')


--1.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.59

   !	With the addition of the B/W list support code, the -R option
   	was broken such that the smfAccess*() functions by default
   	denied the % relay hack (-Z +reject-percent-relay). The old
   	behaviour has been restored (-Z -reject-percent-relay) and
   	controlled through -R or -Z.

   !	Fixed handling of negative responses vs socket errors. The
   	former should still issue a QUIT to the server before closing
   	the socket. Reported by Panagiotis Christias.

   !	The -B option was causing a file descriptor leak. Reported by
   	Simon Jones.

   !	Added experimental code to implment milter specific SMTP
	commands using the libmilter xxfi_unknown handler. This
	requires BOTH sendmail and libmilter be built with

   		APPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-DSMFI_VERSION=4')

	specified in your devtools/Site/site.config.m4 file. This
	would allow for an administrator to get and/or remove
	individual cache entries without having to stop the milter.

   	Command processing is restricted only to hosts that have
   	either:

   		milter-ahead-command:ip		OK
   		milter-ahead-command:hostname	OK

   	defined in the access.db. Also if you use FEATURE(`great_pause')
   	you will require either:

   		GreatPause:ip			0
   		GreatPause:hostname 		0

   	For example you should have this at a minimum:

   		milter-ahead-command:127.0.0.1	OK
   		GreetPause:127.0.0.1		0

   	The extra SMTP commands are:

   		milter-ahead cache-get $KEY
   		milter-ahead cache-remove $KEY

   	Where $KEY is the cache key to get or remove. Due to design
	limitations in the libmilter API, a successful command is
	returned as 500 5.0.0 and unsuccessful command will be 500
	5.y.z and a textual response.

   	See contrib/milter-cmd.sh for an example shell script using
	nc(1) to provide a simple command line interface.

--1.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   +	Added -H option to disable {rcpt_host} call-ahead if there
   	is no entry in the -N table. Requested by Geoff Steer.

   +	I've adding full B/W list support semantics common to all my
   	milters. Currently this code is enabled; use -UENABLE_BW_LIST_SUPPORT
   	to disable it.

   !	The fallback HELO string was "127.0.0.1", but is now "[127.0.0.1]"
   	which is the proper RFC compliant (commonly accepted) form.

  !!	Fixed bug in MX list pruning code that could cause the milter
   	to crash.

   +	Added -i option to try the implicit MX of {rcpt_host} when no
	other MX answers. Used in special cases where for example
	departmental subdomain MXes point to gateway MX and rely on the
	implicit MX rule with an A record to route the mail internally.
	Requested by Panagiotis Christias.

   !	Changed code that finds this host's MX preference to match
   	against the interface's {if_addr} instead of {if_name}, just
   	in case interface name is different from the MX name.

   !	Have disabled the pruning of blacklisted MX hosts just prior to
   	the call-ahead. Its my feeling that this "feature" is redundant,
   	overkill, not utilised, and just a waste of CPU. To enable, use
   	the compile time flag -DENABLE_PRUNE_BLACKLIST_MX. This code
   	will eventually be removed unless strong arguments to keep it
   	are made.

   +	Added -C option to provide a negative response cache TTL. The -c
	option now becomes the positive response cache TTL. Requested by
	Panagiotis Christias.

   +	Added call to cacheGarbadgeCollect() in filterClose(), which
	went walk-about. Reported by Panagiotis Christias.

   !	cacheGarbageCollect() simplified to use the milter connection
	ID for the GC frequency counter. This removes the need for a
	separate variable and only applies the mutex lock when an
	actual GC should be done. Based on milter-sender 1.7 changes.

--1.0--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

   !	Switched to using Socket2 API with IPv6 support.

--0.10--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.45+

   +	Add -N option to permit domain/next-hop-host lookups from a
   	Berkeley DB file (use makemap(1) to create it). Requested by
   	Chris Wilson.

   	If no mapping is found, then use the value of {rcpt_host}. In
	some instances -n option and mailertable cannot be used
	because all mail passes through an intermediate filtering
	server or appliance that has no knowledge of the recipients
	when there is more than one internal mail store.

   	Consider:

   		MX gateway -> Anti-Virus appliance -> POP domain1.com
   						   -> POP domain2.com
   						   -> ...

	The anti-virus appliance is a closed 3rd party service or
	system that has no knowledge of the valid recipient email
	addresses. In such cases you would like to jump over the
	appliance in order to query the final destination host.

	The -N option provides an alternate mailertable like database,
	since the sendmail mailertable may be disabled or used to
	direct mail to an intermediate filtering machine.

   +	Added -m option to enable MX lookups of {rcpt_host} or -N
   	entries.

   +	Added -M which accepts a comma separated word list of reserved
   	IP address categories to discard when performing MX lookups.

   !	Remove redundant line buffer size check in getSmtpResponse().

--0.9--

   *	A huge thank you to Stephen K Swaney for a DVD set from the
   	wishlist.

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.41

   !	Fixed configure.in script to better handle Berkeley DB library
   	and header searches. All these cases should now work.

   		./configure
   		./configure --with-db
   		./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.2
   		./configure --without-db

   +	Added -F option to replace the MAIL FROM:<> line with MAIL
   	FROM:<sender> when performing the call-ahead. Requested by
   	Joe Pruett. Note if the server being called ahead performs
   	any call-back or call-ahead tests themselves, then this
   	option may have negative undefined results.

   +	Added -R option to disable the %-hack for routed addresses.
	This is roughly equivalent to the following Sendmail rule:

	    SLocal_check_rcpt
	    R$* % $* @ $+	$#error $@ 5.7.1 $: "550 routed address relaying denied"

   !	Fixed time stamp variables to use the time_t instead of
	assuming a long.

   !	filterRcpt(): When the -n option is used, ignore the test
   	that generates the "is not a defined route, skipping" message.
   	Reported by Andreas Thienemann.

   !	Fixed the start-up script to unalias shell function names
	before defining the function. Reported by Francisco of
	Blackant dot Net.

   !	Encapsulated announce/pass/fail output the startup-script to
	support different OS favours; some like pretty output, some
	like it simple.

   -	configure.in: Removed gcc option -fvolatile, which is no longer
   	supported in as of gcc 3.4.

   !	Modified the behaviour of the -b option. When set and the
	primary MX is unreachable or the primary is reachable, but
	returning a 421 server busy or 554 no service welcome message,
	then accept the message.

   +	Added -B option. Suggestion from Erik Hensema. When the
	primary MX is reachable and accepting messages, then reject
	the mail. This does not conform with RFC 974 section
	"Interpreting the List of MX RRs", paragraph 7, sentence 2 and
	3, which only requires mail clients to attempt delivery to the
	primary first, before trying other MXes. This option
	essentially demands that a client only deliver to the primary
	MX when its available.

   !	Synchronisation several error responses with similar tests in
   	milter-sender.

   +	The milter now starts as a background process and can kill a
	previous instance of itself using the -x option. The -X option
	is undocumented, but starts the application as a foreground
	process for the purpose of debugging.

   +	Added support for a /etc/mail/milter-name.cf file that can
   	contain command-line options and an optional socket argument.

   !	The socket argument is now optional.

   !	The above three changes allow for a simplified startup script
	template for use by all my milters.

   !	When calling ahead to the next machine, the RCPT address as
	given should be used and not parsed for sendmail's plus detail
	support. Reported by Kevin Spicer.

  !!	Updated LICENSE.TXT.

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.40

   !	Renamed DataInitFromBytes() -> DataInitWithBytes() to remain
	consistent with my naming/action conventions. A *FromType is a
	copy from source and a *WithType is an assignment and/or
	passing of responsiblity of source.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.39

   +	Added -z option to select cache type and file name, replacing
	compile time options.

   !	Fixed FreeBSD cache problem with smfSetProcessOwner() before
   	any files (specifically the cache) are opened.

   !	fitlerRcpt() now checks if the macro returned for {if_name}
   	is NULL and tries alternatives. This might happen if
   	confMILTER_MACROS_CONNECT was redefined and the {if_name}
   	left out. Reported by Robert Waldner.

   !	Fixed the configuration file to recognise OpenBSD. Reported by
	Francisco of Blackant dot Net.

   !	Fixed the start-up script to unalias shell function names
	before defining the function. Reported by Francisco of
	Blackant dot Net.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.38

   +	Bumped version to clearly indicate a new version after some
	people got hold of pre-release work in progress.

--0.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.37

   +	Add VERSION.TXT to configuration for use by sendmail.shtml.

   !	Fix makefile ownership target to assert correct state directory
   	permissions.


--0.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.36 for major smdb() update to solve threading
   	issues and a possible memory corruption problem

   +	Added contrib/milter-lives.sh cron script check that my
	milters remain running.

   +	configure.in: add --enable-startup-dir and better handling of
	defaults for different platforms.

   !	configure.in: changed handling of --localstatedir defaults for
	different platforms.

   !	Fix install.sh to assert the file permissions of the milter in
   	sbin.

   !	The hostname given to the HELO command for the call-ahead is
	now the value of the Sendmail $j macro.

   !	The existing -t option has been renamed to -T to make way for
	the new -t option. The new -t option is the sendmail/milter
	I/O timeout and -T is the milter/spamd I/O timeout.

   !	vSetReply() not checks for an MI_FAILURE from smfi_setreply().

   !	Fix memory leak from filterRcpt() not released in
  	filterClose().

   +	Set working directory to the state directory, where is can
	write a core file in the event of crash.

   !	nullWorkSpace() now takes a `where' string to report in what
	hook it failed.

   +	Add call-ahead cache support and -c option.

   +	Add -n option to always force the call-ahead to a specific host.
   	Requested by Claudio Eichenberger.

   !	Fix documentation concerning mailertable setup.

   !	Replaced some commom code shared by all my milters. See libsnert
   	Sendmail Filter API (smf).

   !	Standardised the -v option across all my milters. Also support
   	textual bit names.

   ! 	Modified license.


--0.3--

   +	Added -b option. If milter-ahead is being run on a secondary
	backup MX (vs. a boarder gateway), then in the event that the
	primary fails to answer connections, the mail should be
	accepted. Suggested by Alexander Bochmann.

   +	Add named socket unlink code to atExitCleanUp() to work around the
   	fact the libmilter doesn't do it itself.

   !	filterRcpt() fix stripping [ and ] from {rcpt_host} that may
   	be set in mailertable.

   +	milter-date.sh.in: add 2nd brute-force kill attempt to correspond
   	with milter-sender and milter-spamc scripts.

   +	Saves a pid file in /var/lib/milter-ahead/pid. Yes, I know I
	should save it in /var/run/milter-ahead.pid, but that assumes
	a process that runs as root all the time, since /var/run
	typically needs root to access and there is no guarantee that
	the milter starts as root. milter-ahead changes process
	ownership early in the process and I choose not to save the
	pid until just after all the setup code and before the version
	log lines.

   +	install.sh.in: The milter-*.mc file is copied to /etc/mail.

   +	Add compile-time option to change the default SMTP port for special
   	setups. Requested by Ron DiVecchia.

   *	As someone pointed out to me, my milters could be simply specified
   	within your sendmail.mc file with:

		include(`milter-sender.mc')dnl
		include(`milter-date.mc')dnl
		include(`milter-7bit.mc')dnl
		include(`milter-spamc.mc')dnl

	Assumes that *.mc are found in /etc/mail along side the sendmail.mc
	script. If you use milter-sender, then you don't need milter-ahead,
	otherwise, milter-ahead comes before milter-date.

	The milters are ordered in this way because:

		milter-sender and milter-ahead work on everything BEFORE
		the DATA (message content) command.

		milter-date, milter-7bit, milter-spamc work with the message
		content AFTER the DATA command '.'

		milter-date looks only at message headers.

		milter-7bit looks at message headers and MIME parts over the
		entire message body.

		milter-spamc looks at message headers and only the first 64K
		of the message body. Scanning for spam is considered to be
		an intensive task that I think it shoulc come last. Like wise
		for anti-virus filters.

--0.2--

   +	Added index.shtml documentation.

   !	Fixed fetch and display of queue-id in filterRcpt() and filterClose().

--0.1--

   +	Initial private release.
